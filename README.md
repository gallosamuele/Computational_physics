# Computational_physics

A collection of Computational Physics projects, Python scripts, and Jupyter notebooks for simulations, experiments, and hands-on learning. Work in progress.

# About

This repository collects small-to-medium scale computational physics experiments and projects created during coursework and self-study. The goal is to document what I learn, provide reusable code snippets, and build a public portfolio of well-documented projects.

What you'll find here:

Interactive Jupyter notebooks for numerical experiments and demonstrations,
Reusable Python scripts and utilities for simulations, data processing, and visualization,
Structured projects with clear instructions for reproduction.
